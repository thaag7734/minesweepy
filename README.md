# MinesweePy

## What is MinesweePy?
MinesweePy is an open-source implementation of the popular Windows game **Minesweeper**. MinesweePy was built entirely from scratch in Python 3.7 using the [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html "Tkinter docs") library for graphics and most gameplay functionality.

## Why was MinesweePy created?
This was a project that I created for my programming class during my sophomore year in high school (2018-19).

## Can I use some of your code in my own project(s)?
Of course! You're welcome to use my code, as long as you give credit.

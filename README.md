# MinesweePy

#### **NOTE**: As of November 7th, 2021, this repo has been archived. This is a very hacky project which uses a lot of weird techniques, is inefficient and has many other glaring issues in the code, relating to both style and functionality. I may revisit this at some point and make a fork with improvements, but for now, I think it's time to lay this to rest.

### What is MinesweePy?
MinesweePy is an open-source implementation of the popular Windows game **Minesweeper**. MinesweePy was built entirely from scratch in Python 3.7 using the [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html "Tkinter docs") library for graphics and most gameplay functionality.

### Why was MinesweePy created?
This was a project that I created for my programming class during my sophomore year in high school (2018-19).

### Is this compatible with Python <3.7?
Yes! MinesweePy is confirmed to work with Python >= 2.7.16 as of March 14th, 2019.

### I just want to play it. How do I go about installing MinesweePy?
Just download the standalone MinesweePy.exe file in the /dist folder and run it, no installation needed.

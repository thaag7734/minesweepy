# MinesweePy

### What is MinesweePy?
MinesweePy is an open-source implementation of the popular Windows game **Minesweeper**. MinesweePy was built entirely from scratch in Python 3.7 using the [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html "Tkinter docs") library for graphics and most gameplay functionality.

### Why was MinesweePy created?
This was a project that I created for my programming class during my sophomore year in high school (2018-19).

### Is this compatible with Python <3.7?
Yes! MinesweePy is confirmed to work with Python >= 2.7.16 as of March 14th, 2019.
